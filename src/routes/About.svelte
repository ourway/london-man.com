  I've been designing and building distributed systems for more years than I
  probably care to mention. However, since it is also so much fun I'll probably
  keep on doing this onward - until they'll pry the keyboard out of my cold dead
  hands or something to that effect. :). Currently I am Head of Python
  engineering at Revolut Ltd.
